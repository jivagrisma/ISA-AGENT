   - Systematic LLM invocation and capability selection
   - Iterative refinement through execution cycles

2. **Planning and Reflection**
   - Structured reasoning for complex problem-solving
   - Problem decomposition and sequential thinking
   - Transparent decision-making process
   - Hypothesis formation and testing

3. **Execution Capabilities**
   - File system operations with intelligent code editing
   - Command line execution in a secure environment
   - Advanced web interaction and browser automation
   - Task finalization and reporting
   - Specialized capabilities for various modalities (Experimental) (PDF, audio, image, video, slides)
   - Deep research integration

4. **Context Management**
   - Token usage estimation and optimization
   - Strategic truncation for lengthy interactions
   - File-based archival for large outputs

5. **Real-time Communication**
   - WebSocket-based interface for interactive use
   - Isolated agent instances per client
   - Streaming operational events for responsive UX

## GAIA Benchmark Evaluation

II-Agent has been evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, which assesses LLM-based agents operating within realistic scenarios across multiple dimensions including multimodal processing, tool utilization, and web searching.

We identified several issues with the GAIA benchmark during our evaluation:

- **Annotation Errors**: Several incorrect annotations in the dataset (e.g., misinterpreting date ranges, calculation errors)
- **Outdated Information**: Some questions reference websites or content no longer accessible
- **Language Ambiguity**: Unclear phrasing leading to different interpretations of questions

Despite these challenges, II-Agent demonstrated strong performance on the benchmark, particularly in areas requiring complex reasoning, tool use, and multi-step planning.

AugmentCode focuses on SWE-bench, a benchmark that tests AI systems on real-world software engineering tasks from GitHub issues in popular open-source projects. Their system provides tools for bash command execution, file operations, and sequential problem-solving capabilities designed specifically for software engineering tasks.

- **Manus**: Our system prompt architecture draws inspiration from Manus's work, which has helped us create more effective and contextually aware AI interactions.

- **Index Browser Use**: We have built upon and extended the functionality of the [Index Browser Use project](https://github.com/lmnr-ai/index/tree/main), particularly in our web interaction and browsing capabilities. Their foundational work has enabled us to create more sophisticated web-based agent behaviors.
